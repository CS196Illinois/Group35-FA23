Founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google has become synonymous with online search and innovation, shaping the digital landscape in profound ways. With 47.24% of its stock floated, Google''s ownership structure reflects a balance between public and institutional investors, with 62.41% of shares held by major financial entities. The company has strategically undergone two stock splits, a financial maneuver aimed at enhancing liquidity and accessibility for a broader investor base.\n",

    "Google''s stock performance reflects the dynamic nature of the tech industry, with a 52-week high of $142.38 and a low of $85.57. These fluctuations capture the ebb and flow of the digital marketplace where Google continues to play a leading role. Guiding the company through its evolution is Sundar Pichai, who assumed the role of CEO in 2015, bringing a keen focus on artificial intelligence and cloud computing to Google''s expansive portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google''s average trading volume of 20.9 million shares per day highlights the consistent and robust interest in the company''s stock. Beyond its roots as a search engine, Google has diversified its offerings, including products like Android, YouTube, and a suite of cloud services. As the tech landscape continues to evolve, Google, under Pichai''s leadership, remains at the forefront of innovation, influencing how people access information and connect in the digital age.''');\"\"\")"
